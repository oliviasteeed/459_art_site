# IAT 459 Final Project: ARTEXPLORE Art Website
Olivia Steed and Mackenzie Scholz 

Our website allows people to explore artworks and artifacts included in the Metropolitan Museum of Artâ€™s open data collection of 470,000 artworks.  

The works are labeled with different dimensions, so users can initially sort by the type of work (ie. painting, coin, brass) and then can filter by other attributes like artist, country, city, culture, period, department, and accession year. 

This allows them to explore images and information from the reserves of the museum remotely and view things that are not displayed in person. In addition, filtering allows users to learn about specific mediums, artists, or time periods by comparing works in each category. Once they sign up, members can save works to their favourites to create a personal repository of works.
